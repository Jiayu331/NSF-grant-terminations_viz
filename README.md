TidyTuesday 20250506 NSF grant terminations data wrangling and visualization practice

In the final visualization, the plot was generated with R code but further edited in adobe illustrator. Items edited in illustrator:

added the plot title, subtitle, caption and descriptions;
edited the font and size of legend and state names on the plot;
changed the grayscale of the color indicating missing data.
